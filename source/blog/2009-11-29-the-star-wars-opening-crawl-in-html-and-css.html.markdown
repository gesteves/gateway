I’m done: the [Star Wars opening crawl][sw], built using only HTML & CSS. Caveats: It only works in Safari 5 and the [WebKit Nightly][webkit]. Nothing else supports the CSS and [3D transforms][3d] and [animations][anim] I used (yet), but I just wanted to see if it could be done. Here's a video of it on [YouTube][youtube], in case I run out of bandwidth for the day and it stops working.
