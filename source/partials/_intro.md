**Hello, there**. I’m a Venezuelan-American web developer based in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, right in the heart of [Grand Teton National Park](https://www.allencompassingtrip.com/tagged/grand-teton-national-park). I’ve been building websites for over 20 years, and I’m currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [Vox Media](https://www.voxmedia.com), where I lead a team charged with building first-class editorial tools for journalists across the world. Previously at Vox, I’ve led multiple teams as engineering manager & lead engineer, including the Services team, bringing [Chorus](https://getchorus.voxmedia.com/) to newspapers such as the _Chicago Sun-Times_, _Deseret News_, and the _Minneapolis Star Tribune_; the Revenue Platforms team, helping build better advertising tools & products for our networks; and the Performance team, helping make our sites as fast as possible. I was also a senior front-end engineer at [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com), helping build a sweet, responsive, better performing site, as well as cool editorial features like [Fanboys](https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5307992/inside-the-mind-of-a-fanboy) and [The&nbsp;Verge&nbsp;50](https://www.theverge.com/a/the-verge-50).

In my free time, I’m also a wildlife & landscape photographer, and you can see some of my work on my website, [All-Encompassing Trip](https://www.allencompassingtrip.com). This year one of my photographs, [Close Encounter at Antelope Flats](https://www.allencompassingtrip.com/2019/4/16/2619/close-encounter), was chosen as one of the four highly commended photos in [London’s Natural History Museum’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year, People’s Choice Awards](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/wpy/gallery/2020-close-encounter).
