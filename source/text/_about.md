Hello, there. I’m a Venezuelan-American web developer & engineering leader based in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, right in the heart of Grand Teton National Park, on Shoshone-Bannock, Eastern Shoshone, and Cheyenne land. I’ve been building websites for over 20 years, and currently I’m an engineering manager at [Stitch Fix][sf], where I’m leading a team of engineers working on [Freestyle][fr].

Previously, I was a senior engineering manager at [Vox Media][vm], where I led multiple teams, including the Editorial Tools team, building first-class editorial tools for journalists across the world; the Services team, bringing [Chorus][ch] to newspapers such as the _Chicago Sun-Times_, _Deseret News_, and _Minneapolis Star Tribune_; the Revenue Platforms team, building better advertising tools & products; and the Performance team, making the sites as fast as possible. I was also a front-end engineer at [The Verge][tv], where I helped rebuild the site to make it responsive, and worked on many high-touch editorial features such as [The Verge 50][v50] and [Fanboys][fan].

Before that, I worked as a front-end engineer at [Piictu][piictu] and [DailyMe][dm], and as an independent web developer for over a decade, with a brief stint in the Venezuelan oil industry during that time.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my spouse and our [three rambunctious cats][pb], and heading into the mountains whenever I can.
