This website is a very simple [Middleman][mi] app, which I call [Gateway][gtwy], hosted on [Netlify][net]. Why Middleman? I’ve been a [Ruby on Rails][ror] developer for over a decade, and Middleman shares a lot of commonalities with Rails, including a lot of helper methods, ERB templates, and of course, Ruby as a language, so I’m very comfortable working in it. I’ve also used it very successfully in the past for high-touch custom editorial features, like [The Verge 50][v50].

In addition to Middleman, this website uses [imgix][i] for image optimization, [Plausible][p] for privacy-friendly traffic analytics, and self-hosted fonts from [Google Fonts][gf], specifically [Playfair Display][pd], [Lato][lato], and [IBM Plex Mono][ipm]. It doesn’t use cookies or collect personal information of any kind.

The cover photos on the home page were both made by me: [The Tetons at First Light][fl] in light mode, and [Comet NEOWISE over Grand Teton National Park][neo] in dark mode.
