**Hello, there**. I’m a Venezuelan-American web developer based in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, right in the heart of [Grand Teton National Park](https://www.allencompassingtrip.com/tagged/grand-teton-national-park). I’ve been building websites for over 20 years, and I’m currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [Vox Media](https://www.voxmedia.com), where I lead a team charged with building first-class editorial tools for journalists across the world. Previously at Vox, I’ve led multiple teams as engineering manager & lead engineer, including the Services team, bringing [Chorus](https://getchorus.voxmedia.com/) to newspapers such as the _Chicago Sun-Times_, _Deseret News_, and _Minneapolis Star Tribune_; the Revenue Platforms team, helping build better advertising tools & products for our networks; and the Performance team, helping make our sites as fast as possible. I was also a Senior Front-End Engineer at _[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com)_, helping build a [sweet, responsive, better performing site](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/2/6096609/welcome-to-verge-2-0), as well as cool editorial features like _[Fanboys](https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5307992/inside-the-mind-of-a-fanboy)_ and _[The&nbsp;Verge&nbsp;50](https://www.theverge.com/a/the-verge-50)_. You can find more details about my professional trajectory on my [résumé](/resume.html).

Outside of work, I’m a wildlife & landscape photographer, and I publish my photography on my website, _[All-Encompassing Trip](https://www.allencompassingtrip.com)_. This year one of my photographs, _[Close Encounter at Antelope Flats](https://www.allencompassingtrip.com/2019/4/16/2619/close-encounter)_, was chosen as one of the four highly commended photos in the [Wildlife Photographer of the Year, People’s Choice Awards](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/wpy/gallery/2020-close-encounter), organized by the Natural History Museum in&nbsp;London.
