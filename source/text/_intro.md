**Hello, there**. I’m a Venezuelan-American web developer & engineering leader based in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, right in the heart of Grand Teton National Park. I’ve been building websites for over 20 years, and right now I'm taking a break between jobs.

Previously, I was a Senior Engineering Manager at [Vox Media][vm], where I’ve led multiple teams, including the Editorial Tools team, building first-class editorial tools for journalists across the world; the Services team, bringing [Chorus][ch] to newspapers such as the _Chicago Sun-Times_, _Deseret News_, and _Minneapolis Star Tribune_; the Revenue Platforms team, helping build better advertising tools & products for our networks; and the Performance team, helping make our sites as fast as possible.

Outside of work, I’m a wildlife & landscape photographer, and I publish my photography on my website, _[All-Encompassing Trip][aet]_. Last year one of my photographs, _[Close Encounter at Antelope Flats][ce]_, was chosen as one of the four highly commended photos in the [Wildlife Photographer of the Year, People’s Choice Awards][wpy], organized by the Natural History Museum in&nbsp;London.
