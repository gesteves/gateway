Outside of work, I’m a photographer, specializing in black & white [wildlife][wi] and [landscape][la] photography in and around [Grand Teton National Park][grte] and other national parks. I publish my photography on my website, [All-Encompassing Trip][aet], on [Instagram][ig], and on [Flickr][flickr], among a few other social networks.

In 2021, one of my photographs, [Close Encounter at Antelope Flats][ce], was chosen as one of four highly commended photos in London’s Natural History Museum’s [Wildlife Photographer of the Year, People’s Choice Awards][wpy]. I’ve also been featured in the [BBC][bbc], the [Jackson Hole News & Guide][jhng], [Jackson Hole Magazine][jhm], and the May 2021 issue of [GEO Magazine][geo].

I strive to minimize the environmental impact of my work by considering the potential ecological ramifications of publishing my photos, and of the equipment, processes, and techniques I use to make them. I follow [Leave No Trace][lnt] principles at all times, abide by all applicable laws and regulations for the locations and parks I visit, and avoid, to the best of my abilities, causing any damage to natural and cultural resources. All my wildlife photography is made in the wild, without baiting, and attempting to disrupt my subjects as little as possible, without engaging in behaviors that endanger them, myself, or others.
