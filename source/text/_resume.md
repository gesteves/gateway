## Profile

I’ve been building websites in a variety of languages and frameworks,
both professionally and for fun, for over 20 years. In that time, I’ve
enjoyed creating performant, accessible, thoughtful products that are
joyful to use and are backed by robust, well-architected systems; and
more importantly, building, nurturing, and leading diverse, inclusive
teams, and fostering a team culture that enables people to thrive and do
their best work. I’m on the lookout for remote opportunities to continue
to exercise this kind of leadership while building products that effect
positive change on the world.
